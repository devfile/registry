# Contributing to this registry

This document outlines the requirements for contributing a devfile stack or sample to this repository.

The [devfile registry structure](https://github.com/devfile/api/blob/main/docs/proposals/registry/registry-structure.md#repository-structure) design doc provides some useful background information on the structure of resources in a devfile registry (and its Git repository).

## Prerequisites

The following are required to build the devfile index container image containing your stack or sample:

- Docker 17.06 or later
- Git

## Stacks

### Contributing

1) Verify your Devfile stack functions with odo.
  
    - Core odo v2 functions such as `odo create --devfile <devfile.yaml>`, `odo push`, `odo url create` should work with the devfile.
    - Core odo v3 functions such as `odo init`, `odo dev`, `odo deploy` should work with the devfile. 
    - PR tests on this repository will verify this functionality as well.

2) Verify your Devfile stack functions with Che.
  
    - Opening the URL `https://workspaces.openshift.com/#<devfile_url>` in your browser should start a workspace where `exec` commands run successfully. Type `task+<space>` in the IDE command palette to see the list of available commands.

3) Verify your Devfile stack has the following metadata fields at a minimum:

    - Name: The name of the devfile stack, e.g. `java-springboot`.
    - Display Name: The longer name of your devfile stack, e.g. `Spring Boot®`.
    - Description: A brief description of your devfile stack, e.g. `Spring Boot® using Java`.
    - Version: The version of your stack, in semnatic version format, e.g. `1.0.0`.

4) Add a folder for the stack to `stacks/` in this repository.
  
    - Make sure the name matches the devfile stack's name and be in the format `<language>-<framework>`. E.g. `java-quarkus`, `python-django`, etc.

5) In case one of your components has an image, use a fixed version tag (e.g `<image>:1.1.0`) instead of `latest`. Our renovate bot will take care of the updates to your image's tag.

6) Add the devfile.yaml and any other necessary files for the stack under the stack folder.

7) Run the `.ci/build.sh` to build the registry into a container image.
  
    - This will also validate the devfiles in this repository, making sure they conform to a minimum standard.
    - This step will also be run in the PR build for the repository.

8) Open a pull request against this repository with a brief description of the change.

### Updating

Updating an existing devfile stack is relatively straightforward:

1) Find the stack under the `stacks/` folder that you wish to update.
2) Make the necessary changes to the stack, such as: updating image tags, commands, starter projects, etc.
3) Update the version of stack, following the [semantic versioning format](https://semver.org/).

    - When updating a stack with a newer version of the devfile specification (e.g., 2.1.0 -> 2.2.0), the previous version of the stack **must** be kept for a minimum of one (1) year.
4) Test your changes:

    - Minimally, testing with odo v2 (`odo create`, `odo push`, etc) and odo v3 (`odo init`, `odo dev`, etc) is recommended, however if your Devfile is used with other tools, it's recommended to test there as well.
5) Open a pull request against this repository with your changes.

### Automatic Stack Image Update



## Samples

### Contributing

The devfile samples used in this devfile registry are stored in the `extraDevfileEntries.yaml` file in the root of the repository. To add a devfile sample:

1) Verify your Sample functions with Che.
  
    - Opening the URL `https://workspaces.openshift.com/#<repository_url>` in your browser should start a workspace where `exec` commands run successfully. Type `task+<space>` in the IDE command palette to see the list of available commands.

2) Open `extraDevfileEntries.yaml` in an editor
3) Add an entry to the file with the following required fields:

    ```yaml
    - name: <sample-name>
        displayName: <sample-display-name>
        description: <sample-description>
        icon: <link-to-sample-icon>
        tags: ["comma", "separated", "list", "of", "tags"]
        projectType: <sample-project-type>
        language: <sample-language>
        git:
        remotes:
            origin: <link-to-sample-git-repository>
    ```

4) Fill in the fields in the angle brackets based on your sample. Note that there must be only one git remote for the devfile sample.
5) Open a pull request against this repository with your changes.

### Updating

To update a sample:

1) Open `extraDevfileEntries.yaml` in an editor.
2) Find the entry for the sample you wish to update.
3) Make the necessary changes.
4) Open a pull request against this repository with your changes.

## How to Test Changes

### Odo

odo v2: `odo create` and `odo push` to test devfile changes. See [odo v2 Doc](https://odo.dev/docs/2.5.0/using-odo/create-component) for more details.

odo V3: `odo init` and `odo dev` to test devfile changes. See [odo v3 Doc](https://odo.dev/docs/command-reference/init) for more details.

### Che

Opening the URL `https://workspaces.openshift.com/#<repository_url>` in your browser should start a workspace where `exec` commands run successfully. Type `task+<space>` in the IDE command palette to see the list of available commands.

### Console

In developer view, create an application via `Import from Git`. Provide git repository Url and verify if the application can be built and ran successfully.
Note: Currently Console only works with devfile v2.2.0 samples with outer loop support.
