# registry

Devfile registry - storing contents of the public community, OCI-based, devfile registry hosted at <https://registry.devfile.io>.

The public registry is updated weekly, by 12pm EST Wednesdays, with any updated stacks in this repository.

## Registry Status

## Registry Updates

The staging devfile registry, <https://registry.stage.devfile.io> is refreshed upon each commit to main in this repository. Production, <https://registry.devfile.io>, promoted manually and as mentioned above, is done each Wednesday, as needed.

If you are a stack owner and need to request an urgent refresh of <https://registry.devfile.io> before Wednesday (for example if a stack is broken), please open an issue in the [devfile/api](https://github.com/devfile/api) repository outlining the following:

- Stack name
- Why the refresh is needed
- Why the refresh cannot wait until the next regularly scheduled refresh
- `/area registry` somewhere in the issue description, so that the `area/registry` label gets added.
